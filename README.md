<h3 align="left">## Hello, my name is Paulo Ricardo. Welcome!</h1>

<p align="left"> 
  Since I was 16, when I discovered how games work behind the scenes, I found my passion for programming. Since then, I have immersed myself in self-taught studies, continuously striving to improve my skills and create solutions through code, which has become a true daily motivation.

Currently, I work as a Full Stack Developer at a startup, where I have the opportunity to apply and expand my knowledge in practice. Additionally, I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development, always exploring new technologies and developing software solutions.
